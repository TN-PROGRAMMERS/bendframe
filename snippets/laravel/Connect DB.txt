        
error:        
------  
problem : I have code like this to connect my server database:
      
    <?php    
    $con = mysqli_connect("", "username", "password", "databasename");
    if (mysqli_connect_errno()) {
        echo "Failed to connect to MySQL: " . mysqli_connect_error();
    }
      
      
solution : 
----------
      
mysqli_connect("","username" ,"password","databasename");
        
    advice : 
    - Server name cannot be NULL  
    -use loaclhost for server name(In Loacl)
      
    code:
        
        <?php  
            $con = mysqli_connect("localhost","username" ,"password","databasename");
            if (mysqli_connect_errno())
            {
                echo "Failed to connect to MySQL: " . mysqli_connect_error();
            }
        ?>
      
    Or can use MySQLi Procedural
        
        <?php  
            $servername = "localhost";
            $username = "username";
            $password = "password";
            // Create connection
            $con = mysqli_connect($servername, $username, $password);
            // Check connection
            if (!$con) {
                die("Connection failed: " . mysqli_connect_error());
            }
            echo "Connected successfully";
        ?>
